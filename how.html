                <h1>how a VR Martial arts game help in curing ADHD ?</h1>
            
    
                <p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, is a common diagnosis 
                    among school-age children. Boys are twice as likely as girls to receive 
                    a diagnosis of ADHD. Symptoms of the disorder include extremely high 
                    levels of activity, difficulty paying attention, difficulty following 
                    instructions, and more. Many children who struggle with ADHD find that 
                    they have a hard time doing well in school or extracurricular activities.
                <p>
                    
                    <br>
                <p>While there are prescription medications available for ADHD, many parents are hesitant
                   to medicate their children. Surprisingly, a new treatment for ADHD was recently approved 
                   by the FDA: a therapeutic video game. This treatment uses the visual and auditory pathways
                    to help children diagnosed with ADHD learn to focus and calm their symptoms.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For years,<span> studies have shown</span> that visual and auditory stimuli can work effectively as a
                     treatment for children with ADHD. Using video games for ADHD treatment takes advantage of
                      complicated ways the brain, eyes, ears, and motor systems work together to help children improve their ability to focus.</p>
                     
                <h2>Visual And Auditory Stimuli As Treatment</h2>
                 <p>
                    A video game prescription can feel counterintuitive to some parents, as they’ve been told that it’s important to keep their
                     kiddo moving to burn off the seemingly excess energy often associated with ADHD.
                    While exercise can be an important part of ADHD treatment, research shows that there are some benefits 
                    of video games specifically designed to help children with the condition.
                    <br>

                   Benefits of video games prescribed for ADHD can include:
                        <br>
                        * Improvement of visual-spatial skills
                        <br>
                        * Increased hand-eye coordination
                        <br>
                        * Improved ability to utilize visual and auditory content for problem-solving
                        <br>
